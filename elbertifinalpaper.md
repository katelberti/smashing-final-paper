Coding: a six letter word that will instantly instill fear into the hearts of 95% of non-computer science majors that hear it.

But why is that?  What has caused the perception that only nerdy boys that sit in dark rooms with video games and endless supplies of Red Bull are capable of knowing how to code?  Yes, coding is not a super simple task; but it’s not rocket science, people.

Numerous times when I've told friends that I'm taking a coding class this semester they respond with some version of *"Why? Aren't you a Public Relations major?"* Well to answer their question yes, I am; so what? In this day-and-age professors, professionals, and many other individuals constantly stress that people need to be versatile in their skill-sets.  Young professionals are generalists: they are polyglots, “multitaskers,” social-media gurus, video experts, big-data aficionados, as well as strategic thinkers and planners.  Couldn’t those skills only be heightened by adding coding to the mix?

It’s inarguable that the need for individuals with computer skills is on the rise. I already know my friends who are Computer Science majors will likely make double the salary I do and that's ok; but why shouldn't I take advantage of the opportunity to learn a bit of coding while I too have the chance?

Coding can be useful to any major.  The doors that open up from having even a minor-working understanding of coding concepts.

Don’t believe me?  On the same thought-page as my *PR-and-coding-combo-is-weird* friends?  Well, here are a few reasons why knowing how to code is relevant to anyone, can help edge you forward in a large job applicant pool, can keep you “hip-with-the-kids,” and can enhance your overall quality of life (disclaimer: last part is dramatic, but still sort of true).  This one’s for you, haters:

1. **Understand the lingo.**  If someone says they’re going to “use a Bootstrap template to formulate the homepage’s set-up” you don’t want to open-mouth stare at them as if they just said they want to send cats into space.  While you may not be able to personally execute all of the fancy things professional computer gurus are saying to you, being able to understand the logistics and therefore contribute more to the creative process is invaluable.
2. **Be a jack of all trades.**  It’s a competitive world out there and strictly having a Bachelor’s degree on your resume does not hold the weight that it used to.  Candidates need to be as versatile in their skill-set as possible.  Who is more likely to get hired: Candidate A who has completed their B.A. and had multiple years of relevant experiences, or Candidate B who has the same B.A., same number of years of experience, but additionally has proficient knowledge of the CSS and HTML coding language?  Candidate B; no brainer.
3. **Be the thinker AND the doer.**  Three helpful hints for success in the 21st century work environment is to be creative, build relationships, and be ahead of the curve.  What’s more valuable: the employee who thinks up a creative idea and sends it to a 3rd party to execute, or the employee who thinks up a creative idea and can execute it themselves?
4. **Develop a personal website.**  Any Public Relations major – or recent college graduate in general, for that matter – that has started the job search knows they have a zero percent chance of getting hired if they walk into an interview without a personal website.  Sounds dramatic, but it’s the truth.  Employers want to know that you are able to execute, and not just think up a website design, and – most importantly – that you know what a good website design looks like. These things beg an employer to ask the question *“if they can’t design an effective and aesthetically pleasing website for themselves, how can we expect them to design one for our clients?”*
5. **Start a small business.**  Look at Etsy, Pinterest, and other merchandise sites: big hits, right?  Now think of having the creative freedom to develop your own small business product, mantra and theme, then having the capability to design the exact online content you want.  And – bonus – using your own website versus an Etsy-esque site means no pesky royalty fees: cha-ching!
6. **It’s a fun hobby.**  Ok ok, coding may not be the first word that comes to mind when you think of “relaxing in your off time,” but hey, you never know!  A lot of individuals have fun and take pride in mastering a new skill.  According to The Wire magazine – a fan-favorite amongst the computer science peeps – a lot of people who enjoy learning math theories or even new languages enjoy the challenge of learning to code because it utilizes that same general repetition principles.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to say that everyone should drop what they’re doing and go become coding geniuses; that’s not realistic.  However, coding is a skill that more people should considered delving into.  Coding may not be the bread-and-butter of your academic or career focus, but it can surely be that little spread of jam that livens up the whole meal.

So to my friends who questioned my class choices this semester I say *you to do, but I’m going to do me and learning some coding and hopefully get a step ahead of the curve.*


Still not convinced?  That’s fine; seeking a second opinion is always a valid.  Check out these articles from some cool-kids who wrote some very compelling arguments that helped me develop my own stance on the topic:
